                    <p>I am an Innovative, forward-thinking, and Hardworking, offering a two-year experience. 
                        My experience may not be too much, but I am very energetic and give my all to satisfy my client. 
                        From my past experiences, I learn that I have the skills to bring people together to work in the 
                        same direction, leading a small team. In my free time, 
                        I like to work on some of my projects or adding new skills to my skill set, 
                        like solving daily life problems using technology. One such issue I face every 
                        day is setting up an alarm for the next day, checking weather conditions, 
                        and write up tomorrow's goals; to do all this has to use different apps. 
                        My idea is to create a single app for all this, which is still in progress. 
                    </p>
                    <p>I like to work as a freelancer. It helps me to be more creative, and I learn to interact with clients globally. 
                        You can find my Fiverr account details below and read some of my reviews to understand my work better. 
                        I like to share my idea only, which help me to connect with like-minded people and collaborate with 
                        them to work on that. 
                        I also want to attend meetups, which help to increase my knowledge and is a great way 
                        to make a connection and understand people from a different culture.

                            <p>My educational experience or my career path starts from my high school last year. 
                                I first learned computer science in high school and gained my interest in the 
                                development and data analysis. Following my career path, I choose to do a bachelor's 
                                in computer science and technology. In those four years of education, I learned all the 
                                essential skills like programming, Software engineering, Agile methodology and gain problem 
                                solving skills to land on my first job. Those were the most beautiful days of my life learning 
                                and applying those learnings in the project. And making things work makes me learn more and its 
                                even more fun to do with your friends who share the same goal to create new things. My habit of 
                                learning and building a successful and useful app for customers encouraged me to do an Information 
                                technology and Business analysis course. With the help of this course, I hope to learn some business 
                                and data analytics with the help of which i can get an idea of how successful my app will be.
                                 I hope to work as a data analyst for a startup because learning and gaining experience is double 
                                 compared to others.

                        I have worked on many projects throughout my career as a software developer. 
                        What important is to plan the project and create the SRS. In this way, 
                        in case of issue or misunderstanding about any topic during work can be 
                        solved easily with SRS. Working on a significant and essential part is critical, 
                        so I always try to do that in small pieces. A detailed plan is necessary for the
                         project to go smoothly. For example, last year, I worked on a big project Unirely. 
                         Its primary users are students who have a dream of study abroad. This app helps them 
                         with their application process, writing essays, and SOP. As a software developer,
                          my work is to develop a solution for users by strictly following the Software requirement 
                          document. Sometimes we have to meet with the client explaining what we did and what we have 
                          to do because involving the client in the project is essential. One of the significant 
                          challenges we face is when we have to make an update on the live website and found
                           a bug at that time, which makes the room environment very hot, but it exciting too.
                            I lead a team of frontend developers.As a frontend developer, we have a 
                            responsibility to make the app look and feel as good as possible because 
                            this will be the very first thing user will see. I have worked on many other 
                            projects too. One such was "needtoall" It was for my self as I have to set the 
                            alarm for next make a todo list and get an update of weather conditions for all 
                            these to have to use different apps, so I thought of making a single platform for 
                            all these functions.

                <span>I worked as a software developer for a startup named Venturepact. As a developer, I have to design, build, and maintain web sites and mobile applications using authoring or scripting language, content creation tools, management tools, and digital media.
                    Identify problems uncovered by testing or customer feedback and correct problems
                    write supporting code for a web application or websites or mobile application
                    Meetups with customers to identify needs and changes required for product success.
                    As a developer following a tight schedule, having sprits and a change of requirement is very common. Making all the necessary changes adhering to these constraints became my day-to-day work.
                    Working in a Startup teach me how to work in a fast-paced environment and learning, and then implement the same on the project, test it make faster by reducing it's complexity and test again.

                    <p>My greatest strength is my honesty, dedication to my work, and urging me to learn new things.
                        I love to solve the problem quickly and efficiently, which makes me learn new techniques and see a situation from multiple perspectives. My dedication to my work allows me to work on long projects and give me chances to get along with different peoples.
                        In my way of achieving my goals, I realize my greatest achievements are not my hunger to learn but my problem-solving skills, which makes me learn.                         
                    </p>
                    <p>My weakness is working alone on a project. This is the result of my previous experience in the team. 
                        In my past work experiences, my team usually does most of the things that create a panic situation
                         every time, and as I am detail-oriented to my work, it makes an overburden on me. So I usually try
                          to complete all work all by myself. But now I want to change that and try to have more faith in my team. 
                          I always try to encourage my team to work on time and help them in a different situation, 
                          which helps me improve my leadership qualities and make me a good team player. 
                          Every person has some weaknesses, but overcoming that weakness and making 
                          it an opportunity to learn is my strength.

                <span>I believe that my experience with different techniques and skills makes me a 
                    good match for a software developer as every developer dream of working for a 
                    great company. I have the same vision, so I choose to study business analysis courses
                     to learn new trends and tools necessary for my goal and improve my skill set. 
                     I always have the skills to bring people together to work in the same direction,
                      which helps me choose my course. In my previous job, I have to design, build and 
                      maintain websites and mobile applications using authoring or scripting tools like
                       MEAN Stack and Javascript and for mobile application iconic. Have to do meetups with the client to understand requirements and give a daily report. I have faced many challenges throughout my professional career, and whether it's about the client or new bugs in the software, I learned to be calm and solve one thing at a time. One such problem is when you have to create an animation for a radio button that shows firework when selected and the slide out from the list. It was a difficult problem none of my seniors able to solve the problem. As I have to solve this problem, it took me a whole day for this, but the result was good, and the client likes that. I learned to solve any problem, one should have to clam and visualize what we can do to solve it.
